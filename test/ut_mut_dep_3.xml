<!-- Unit test for securing mutation will not breake model consistency 
Ref to ds_mut_unappr_rt_ths1 parent case.
====================
Prove for parent: There is parent Np and it's child Nc, and there is mut Mc of Nc containgin URI including parent,
then for instance mut Mp of renaming Np should go after Mc otherwise Mc will be broken.
====================
elem3 is the child of elem2, and there is mut Mut_1 that is dep of elem3
elem2 also depends on Mut_1 via it child elem3 because in Mut_1 ENa_Node URI includes elem2
To test:
1. Try to apply Mut2 in elem1 (with rank lower that Mut_1) - rename elem2 - system has to detect 
that this mutation is harmful
