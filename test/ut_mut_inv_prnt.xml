<!-- Unit test for invariant againts mutations order, ref uc_046 
dependency that contradicts with the native order - ref to parent
USER tries to add to v1 child of v2
SYSTEM has to reorder mutations to keep safety: move v1 after v2 
Also the second dependencies are:
1. from mut [cont ref="./../v1"] to v1 which gets reordered.
2. from mut [node id="v3" parent="./v1"] to v1 which gets reordered.
 So SYSTEM has to shift these muts also
