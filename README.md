# Mutli-agent Discrete Events System (DES) modelling framework

The framework provides APIs for creating and running DES models basing on mutli-agent approach.
The model is built from elementary agents. The agent suports mutation specifying by mutation language,
so the model is specified by mutation spec (chromosome) of root element (creation point). 
Framework includes the library of pre-defined native and composite agents.

The model can be created using visial studio application, ref another project [fap2-studio](https://github.com/yborisovstc/fap2-studio-gtk)
Ref also project [fap2-srv](https://github.com/yborisovstc/fap2-srv) for the support of distributed models.

## Branches

- **yb\_daa\_mulcont** - Multi-content support. Introduced named content of agent.
- **yb\_daa\_mc\_opt** - Multi-content support. Optimization.
 

## Getting Started

TBD
